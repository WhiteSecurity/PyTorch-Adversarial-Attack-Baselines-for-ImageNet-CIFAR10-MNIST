> PyTorch adversarial attack baselines for ImageNet, CIFAR10, and MNIST (state-of-the-art attacks comparison)

* This repository provides simple PyTorch implementations for evaluating various adversarial attacks. 
* This repository shows state-of-the-art attack success rates for each dataset.
    * This repository utilizes attack libraries such as [Advertorch](https://github.com/BorealisAI/advertorch), [Foolbox](https://github.com/BorealisAI/advertorch), etc.
* If you have questions about this repository, please send an e-mail to me (dongbinna@postech.ac.kr) or make an issue.

#### ImageNet

* This repository provides a small ImageNet validation dataset of 1,000 classes.
    * This dataset has 5 images per class (total 5,000 images).
* This is a subset of the ImageNet validation dataset.
